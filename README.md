# Image_scraper_selenium

It makes use of selenium and chrome web driver to auto scroll through Google image search results.

The chrome driver for different operating system can be downloaded from this link. I have only included the windows chrome driver since I personally use windows 10 operating system.

Once downloaded your corresponding selenium chrome web driver, Change the DRIVER_PATH variable in the ipython notebook. Also if you do not have selenium installed on os,

you can type the following on your command line interface [or] terminal:

pip install selenium, pillow, requests

Edit the search string as well as the destination folder path.
